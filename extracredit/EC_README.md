## Usage

First, run `make clean; make` in terminal WHILE IN THIS FOLDER to compile the extra credit version of our project.

Run `make ec_test` for testing.

To test on the console yourself, run `./sudoku create SIZE`, where `SIZE` is the number of rows/columns in the Sudoku board. `SIZE` must be between 4 and 81 (although in practice, 16 is the upper bound where our algorithm will run in a reasonable amount of time). Copy the output of this command. Then run `./sudoku solve SIZE' and paste that output. Press Enter and then `control+D` (on Mac) to solve puzzle.
